ðŸ‘‹ OpenAcademics is a community!

Academia is a place of many challenges, where there is often a lack of support and understanding. I wanted to create a space for academics to interact with other academics, irrespective of career stage, discipline, or location. Twitter offered a perfect platform to start this community â€“ In December 2019, OpenAcademics was conceptualized and launched.

Within this community, I am working hard to promote a few key aspects that I want people to associate OpenAcademics with. These include respect, diversity, inclusion, equity, and kindness. I want you to feel like you belong and can find commonality with people of different background, ethnicity, gender/sex/pronouns. And I believe that you can do that across disciplines, and from across the globe. So far, the response has been amazing, and people are truly supportive! 

Diversity makes life beautiful, and it makes us stronger together.

I surveyed the community early on and found representation from USA, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, England, Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Turkey, South Africa, India, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Egypt, Hong Kong, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Nigeria, Japan, Argentina, Armenia, and more.

The members of our community are truly multidisciplinary, representing all disciplines of higher education: natural sciences, applied sciences, humanities, social sciences, and formal sciences with topics covering: biology, chemistry, physics, space sciences, earth sciences, engineering and technology, medicine and health, business, performing and visual arts, comics, history, languages, literature, law, philosophy, theology, anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, politics, psychology, sociology/criminology, social work, computer science, mathematics, and more.

OpenAcademics is more than just a community, it is a family!
